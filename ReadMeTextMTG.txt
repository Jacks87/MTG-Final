When clicking on the link About Us, it takes me to a page where I can read a brief description of what the page is about and also who the creator is, and his/her contact information.

At the top of the About Us page, there is a menu to go back to Home page or to click on contact, it highlights with blue color that we are in the About page, then as part of the menu, you also have Gallery, Inventory and Login/Sign Up.

So I clicked on Gallery, it shows three rows with six images each row. The images are the MTG cards. Above is the menu again, with the Gallery link highlighted, it shows home, contact, about, Gallery, Inventory, Login/Sign Up.

I clicked on Inventory this time, and it took me to where are columns and each one is about a type of card, like creatures, enchantments, artifacts, sorceries and instants, and each column has dropdowns with more cards. Again, above we have the menu with links, we can see home, contact, about, gallery, inventory (highlighted) and login/sign up.

I cliked on login/sign up now, and it took me to where I can login in by typing in my email and password. It also shows the above menu in case I want to go back to the other pages. Login/Sign Up is highlighted now.
